Stack and Queue Using Linked Lists in Python
Description
This Python project demonstrates the implementation of Stack and Queue data structures using Linked Lists.

Stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle where elements are added and removed from the same end.
Queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
Key Features
Stack Operations:

add(value): Adds a value to the top of the stack.
remove(): Removes the top element from the stack.
peek_top(): Displays the top element without removing it.
show(): Displays all elements in the stack.
Queue Operations:

add(value): Adds a value to the rear of the queue.
remove(): Removes the front element from the queue.
peek_front(): Displays the front element without removing it.
show(): Displays all elements in the queue.
How to Use
Clone the repository.
Run the Python script to perform operations on the Stack and Queue.
Modify the script to test different data or operations as needed.
Requirements
Python 3.x
License
